# MatrixManipulation

This project is designed to row reduce matrices into Echelon form to find their solution based on the principles I have learned thus far in Linear Algebra.

The Matrix class is designed to provide the fundamental functionality of matrices and their elementary row operations. These row operations will then be utilized by the Echelon class and others to find the row reduced Echelon matrix.

The Echelon class finds the row reduced Echelon matrix. This class is still being created.

Other classes will be created along the way to provide more functionality.

Ideally, by the time this project is completed, I will be able to output the number of basic and free variables of matrices to determined whether or not a matrix is linearly dependent. I will also be able determine whether solutions are one to one relationships and if that span a given space R.

I would like to be able to use this classes to apply Cramer's Rule to see how the augmented vector b will change when manipulating a given vector in the matrix. This may have applications in stock price evaluations when their prices are based on multivariate linear equations.
