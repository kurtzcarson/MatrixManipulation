# MatrixManipulation

This project is designed to row reduce square matrices into Echelon form to find their solutions and determine various other matrix properties based on the principles I have learned in Linear Algebra.

The Matrix class is designed to provide the fundamental functionality of square and non-square matrices and their elementary row operations.

The SquareMatrix class extends the Matrix class and has function designed to only work with square matrices. I am still working on adding additional functionality for non-square matrices. 

Ideally, by the time this project is completed, I will be able to output the number of basic and free variables of matrices to determined whether or not a matrix is linearly dependent. I will also be able determine whether solutions are one to one relationships and if that span a given space R. I also plan on making a NonSquare Matrix class. In the future, this may completely replace the SquareMatrix class as the functionality will prove to be more general.
